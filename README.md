# `What I Learned in Week 2`

### `CSS Diner`
* A game that aims to teach us how to properly select specific elements in CSS.
* Some important things I've learned with CSS Diner :
    * `#id` = Selects  any element with that id.
    * `A B` = Selects all B inside of A.
    * `#id A` = Selects all A in id. 
    * `.classname` = Selects all elements with that class name. 
    * `*` = Selects all
    * `A.classname`= Selects all A elements that have the same class name.

### `Dev Tools`
This was one of the most interesting thing we learned this week. We used dev tools to see the coding of Ebay and temporarily change some parts of it. We changed the price of a laptop in Ebay, and it was very very exciting.
I used this trick to change an important part of a turkish newspaper and my parents were shocked :))))
* Command + option + j

### `Ugly Webby`
It was a great project to be creative. We used css to make a webpage as ugly as possible! I had so much fun doing this project. I also learned a lot about putting images,changing backgrounds and text color.

### `Copy Kitten`
I did not like this assignment at all. We were supposed to use css to make our table, header and button similar to the images we had. I struggled while doing this assignment but I learned a lot about CSS. I was not able to complete the assignment and my table did not look like the one on the picture at all but at least I tried!

### `Copy Calico`
This assignment was much more fun than the Copy Kitten. We used css to make a webpage that is similar to another webpage. It was very time consuming, but I was able to practice css a lot. It was more helpful for me compare to Copy Kitten. I struggled with header the most. I think it looked similar but I need to work on the spacing and tables more in the future.

### `Boxes CSS`

This project helped me to learn more about the padding, margin, and css tools. We had 4 boxes, and we had to change their styles so that they look like the ones in the picture. I think this took us more than 2 hours but at the end we completed it!
